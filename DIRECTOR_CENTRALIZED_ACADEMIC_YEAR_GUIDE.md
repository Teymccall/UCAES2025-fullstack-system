# 🎯 Director Guide: Setting Centralized Academic Year

## 🚨 **CURRENT SITUATION**

From the screenshots, I can see:
- ✅ **Academic Management page** shows 2027/2028 as "active" 
- ❌ **Centralized system** (used by fee forms) shows "No academic period configured"
- ❌ **Fee structure forms** show placeholder instead of academic year

## 🔍 **THE PROBLEM**

There are **TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS** for academic years:

### **System 1: Academic Management** (What you see in screenshot)
- Location: `/director/academic-management`
- Purpose: Manage academic years, semesters, and rollover processes
- Status: ✅ Working - shows 2027/2028 as active

### **System 2: Centralized Academic Period** (Used by fee forms)
- Location: `systemConfig/academicPeriod` document in Firebase
- Purpose: Provide academic year to all modules (fee forms, student portal, etc.)
- Status: ❌ Not configured - no centralized academic year set

## 🎯 **THE SOLUTION**

The director needs to set the **centralized academic year** which is different from the academic management status.

### **Step 1: Go to Admissions Page**
Navigate to: **Director → Admissions** 

### **Step 2: Find "Set Admission Year" Section**
Look for the "Admission Year Management" card with:
- A dropdown to select academic year
- A "Set as Current Year" button

### **Step 3: Set Centralized Academic Year**
1. **Select** "2027/2028" from the dropdown
2. **Click** "Set as Current Year" button
3. **Confirm** you see success message

### **Step 4: Verify the Fix**
After setting the centralized academic year:
- Fee structure forms should show "2027/2028" instead of placeholder
- Academic year field should have green background with "✓ Auto-filled" badge

## 🔧 **WHY THIS FIXES THE ISSUE**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Academic Management: 2027/2028 (active) ✅
Centralized Config:  Not Set             ❌
Fee Forms:          "Set by director in centralized config" ❌
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Academic Management: 2027/2028 (active) ✅  
Centralized Config:  2027/2028           ✅
Fee Forms:          "2027/2028" with auto-fill indicator ✅
```

## 📊 **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SET CENTRALIZED ACADEMIC YEAR**

The "Set as Current Year" button will:

1. **Create/Update** `systemConfig/academicPeriod` document in Firebase
2. **Set** `currentAcademicYear: "2027/2028 Academic Year"`
3. **Set** `currentAcademicYearId: "lZC3TnteIxwCPpwltKUf"`
4. **Sync** all modules to use the same academic year
5. **Enable** automatic academic year population in fee forms

## 🎯 **VERIFICATION STEPS**

After setting the centralized academic year, verify:

### **1. API Test**
The academic period API should return success:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/academic-period
# Should return: {"success": true, "data": {"academicYear": "2027/2028", ...}}
```

### **2. Fee Forms Test**
- Open any fee structure form
- Academic year field should show "2027/2028" with green background
- Should display "✓ Auto-filled" badge

### **3. Cross-Platform Consistency**
- All finance officer interfaces should show 2027/2028
- Student portal should use 2027/2028
- Lecturer platform should use 2027/2028

---

## 🎯 **SUMMARY**

The director has correctly set the academic year status in Academic Management, but needs to also set the **centralized academic year** in the Admissions page for it to be used by fee forms and other modules.

**Action Required**: Use Admissions page → "Set as Current Year" button → Select 2027/2028

This will sync the centralized system with the academic management status and fix the fee form issue. 🎉
