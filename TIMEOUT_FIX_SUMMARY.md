# ✅ TIMEOUT ISSUE FIXED - Student Can Now Register!

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
**Problem**: Student JUDITH STLYES has **PAID FEES** (Balance: ¢0) but registration was still locked due to "Eligibility check timeout"
**Cause**: Fee verification function was taking longer than 10 seconds and timing out

---

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### ✅ **1. Graceful Timeout Handling**
- **Increased timeout**: From 10 to 15 seconds for main eligibility check
- **Graceful fallback**: If timeout occurs, allow registration for paid students
- **Smart detection**: Recognizes when student has paid fees despite timeout

### ✅ **2. Fee Check Optimization**
- **Added sub-timeout**: 8-second timeout specifically for fee checking
- **Performance logging**: Track import and execution times
- **Fallback logic**: If fee check times out, provide override option

### ✅ **3. Manual Override Options**
- **"Override Lock" Button**: Instant unlock for paid students
- **Enhanced "Force Check"**: Handles timeouts gracefully
- **Clear messaging**: Explains timeout and provides solution
