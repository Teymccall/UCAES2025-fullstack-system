# Cloudinary Setup for UCAES Systems

## Overview
This document explains how to set up Cloudinary for document uploads in the UCAES systems. We use **separate Cloudinary accounts** for different systems to ensure security and organization.

## System Separation

### ðŸŽ“ Admissions System
- **Cloud Name**: `dyvabxsvh`

### 3. Security Considerations

- Rotate API keys regularly

- **Automatic uploads**: Documents are uploaded to Cloudinary when selected
