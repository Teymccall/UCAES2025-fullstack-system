# Applicant ID Immediate Display Fix

## Issue Description
When a new applicant registers an account, the applicant ID was not immediately displayed on the dashboard. The user had to refresh the page to see their applicant ID.

## Root Cause
The issue was occurring because the application ID was being generated and stored in Firebase during registration, but the user state in the AuthContext was only being updated by the Firebase auth state listener. This meant that while the application ID was correctly generated and stored in the database, the user object in the application state didn't have the application ID until the auth state listener triggered again (which happens on page refresh).

## Solution

### 1. Immediate User State Update
Modified the `register` function in `AuthContext.tsx` to immediately update the user state with the application ID after registration:

```typescript
// In AuthContext.tsx - register function
// After generating and storing the application ID
setUser({
  id: userId,
  email,
  name,
  role: 'applicant',
  applicationId
});
```

This ensures that the application ID is immediately available in the user context without requiring a page refresh.

### 2. UI Component Updates

#### ApplicantDashboard.tsx
Modified the `applicationStatus` object to prioritize the user's applicationId from the AuthContext over the applicationData:

```typescript
const applicationStatus = {
  // Other properties...
  applicationId: user?.applicationId || applicationData.applicationId || 'Not generated'
};
```

#### ApplicationIdDisplay.tsx
Added a loading state for the ApplicationIdDisplay component when the application ID is not yet available, instead of not rendering anything:

```typescript
if (!user?.applicationId || user.role !== 'applicant') {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
          <img src={ucesLogo} alt="UCAES Logo" className="h-12 w-12" />
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Your Application ID</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">
              Loading your application ID...
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
          <div className="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg px-4 py-2">
            <div className="animate-pulse h-6 w-32 bg-gray-200 rounded"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing
The solution was tested by restarting the Admission portal server and verifying that the application ID appears immediately after registration without requiring a page refresh.

## Benefits
- Improved user experience by eliminating the need to refresh the page to see the application ID
- More consistent application state management
- Better visual feedback with loading state when the application ID is being generated
