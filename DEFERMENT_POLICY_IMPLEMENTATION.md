# Comprehensive Deferment Policy Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete deferment system implementation that addresses all academic, financial, and administrative aspects of student deferment.

## âœ… What It Means for the Student

### 1. **Temporary Break from Studies**
- âœ… **No Academic Activities**: Students cannot take part in classes, exams, or assessments during the deferred semester
- âœ… **Resume Studies**: Students resume their studies in a future semester, picking up where they left off
- âœ… **System Implementation**: 
  - Course registrations marked with `academicActivitiesPaused: true`
  - `noClasses: true`, `noExams: true`, `noAssessments: true`
  - Academic timeline paused with `academicTimelinePaused: true`

### 2. **Academic Records Are Paused**
- âœ… **GPA/CQPA Unaffected**: No grades or GPA/CQPA are affected during the deferment period
- âœ… **Academic Timeline Shifted**: Student's academic timeline shifts forward
- âœ… **Program Duration Extended**: 4-year program might now complete in 4.5 or 5 years
- âœ… **System Implementation**:
  - `academicImpact.gpaUnaffected: true`
  - `academicImpact.gradesPaused: true`
  - `academicImpact.timelineShifted: true`
  - `academicImpact.expectedCompletionExtended: true`
  - Original expected completion stored for reference

### 3. **Must Follow Official Process**
- âœ… **Approval Required**: Deferment must be approved by the academic affairs office
- âœ… **Formal Application**: Requires formal application with valid reasons
- âœ… **Valid Reasons**: Health issues, financial difficulties, personal emergencies
- âœ… **System Implementation**:
  - Student submits request through portal
  - Director reviews and approves/declines
  - Complete audit trail maintained
  - Status tracking: `pending` â†’ `approved`/`declined`

### 4. **No Tuition Refund (Usually)**
- âœ… **Early Deferment**: If deferment happens early in semester, partial refund may be possible
- âœ… **Fees Rolled Over**: Fees may be rolled over to the next semester
- âœ… **Policy Variations**: Policies vary by institution
- âœ… **System Implementation**:
  - `tuitionStatus.feesPaid` tracking
  - `tuitionStatus.refundEligible` based on timing
  - `tuitionStatus.refundAmount` calculation
  - `tuitionStatus.feesRolledOver` for next semester

### 5. **Student Status: "Deferred"**
- âœ… **Remains on Records**: Student remains on school's records
- âœ… **Not Withdrawn**: Not considered withdrawn or dismissed
- âœ… **Inactive Status**: Listed as inactive or deferred for that semester
- âœ… **System Implementation**:
  - `academicStatus: "deferred"`
  - `defermentStatus: "deferred"`
  - Student portal shows "Deferred (not withdrawn)" status
  - Can be reactivated later
