## Complete Workflow Steps

### 1. **Lecturer Grade Entry**
1. Lecturer logs into the platform

4. Lecturer enters grades for each component:
   - Assessment & Practicals (0-10)
   - Mid-semester Exam (0-20)
   - Final Exam (0-70)
5. System automatically calculates total and letter grade
6. Lecturer reviews and submits grades

### 2. **Grade Submission Process**
1. Grades are saved to `grade-submissions` collection
2. Individual student grades are saved to `student-grades` collection
3. Status is set to `pending_approval`
4. Director receives notification of new submission

### 3. **Director Review Process**
1. Director accesses the Results Approval panel
2. Views pending grade submissions
3. Reviews individual student grades
4. Can approve, reject, or request changes
5. Approved submissions can be published

### 4. **Result Publication**
1. Director publishes approved results
2. Status changes to `published`
3. Results become visible to students
4. Grades are finalized and cannot be modified

### 5. **Student Access**
1. Students log into their portal
2. Navigate to "Grades & Results" page
3. Select academic year and semester
4. View published grades with detailed breakdown
5. See GPA calculations and performance analysis
