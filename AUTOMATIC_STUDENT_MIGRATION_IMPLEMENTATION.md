## 🏗️ **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Data Flow Design**
```
Admission Application → Status Change to "accepted" → Auto-Migration → Student Registration
     ↓                        ↓                           ↓                    ↓
admission-applications → applicationStatus: "accepted" → Cloud Function → student-registrations
```

### **Collections Structure**

#### **1. admission-applications** (Source)
- **Purpose:** Store student applications and track admission status
- **Key Fields:** `applicationStatus`, `personalInfo`, `contactInfo`, `programSelection`
- **Migration Trigger:** When `applicationStatus` changes to "accepted"

#### **2. student-registrations** (Destination)  
- **Purpose:** Store active student registrations for academic operations
- **Key Fields:** `registrationNumber`, `surname`, `otherNames`, `email`, `programme`
- **Migration Tracking:** `transferredFromAdmission`, `originalApplicationId`

#### **3. users** (Updated)
- **Purpose:** Authentication and role management
- **Updates:** Role set to "student", registration number added, student info populated

---

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION COMPONENTS**

### **1. Batch Migration Script** (`automatic-student-migration.js`)
```javascript
// Features:
- ✅ Generate unique registration numbers (UCAES + Year + Sequence)
- ✅ Map admission data to registration format
- ✅ Update user accounts with student information
- ✅ Track migration status and prevent duplicates
- ✅ Error handling and logging
```

### **2. Cloud Function Trigger** (`cloud-function-auto-migration.js`)
```javascript
// Automatic triggers:
- onUpdate: admission-applications/{id} → check status → migrate if approved
- onCall: Manual batch migration for administrators
- onCall: Migration statistics and monitoring
```

### **3. Data Mapping Logic**
```javascript
// Admission → Registration Field Mapping:
personalInfo.surname → surname
personalInfo.otherNames → otherNames  
contactInfo.email → email
programSelection.name → programme
userId → authUid
+ Generated: registrationNumber, currentLevel (100), status (active)
+ Tracking: transferredFromAdmission, originalApplicationId
```

   ```bash
   # Deploy the Cloud Function for automatic migration
   firebase deploy --only functions:onAdmissionStatusChange
   firebase deploy --only functions:batchMigrateApprovedStudents
   firebase deploy --only functions:getMigrationStats
   ```

2. **Set up Monitoring:**
   ```javascript
   // Add to Firebase Console Monitoring
   - Function execution logs
   - Migration success/failure rates
   - Student registration counts
   ```

3. **Configure Notifications:**
   ```javascript
   // Implement email notifications (optional)
   - Welcome emails to newly registered students
   - Admin notifications for migration failures
   ```

## 🔄 **AUTOMATIC MIGRATION WORKFLOW**

### **Trigger Conditions**
1. **Primary Trigger:** `admission-applications` document updated
2. **Status Check:** `applicationStatus` changes to "accepted" 
3. **Duplicate Prevention:** Check if already migrated via `originalApplicationId`
4. **Data Validation:** Ensure required fields are present

### **Migration Process**
1. **Generate Registration Number:** Format: `UCAES{YEAR}{SEQUENCE}`
2. **Map Data Fields:** Transform admission data to registration structure
3. **Create Registration:** Add document to `student-registrations` collection
4. **Update User Account:** Set role to "student", add registration info
5. **Mark as Migrated:** Update admission application with migration status
6. **Log Activity:** Record migration success/failure for auditing

### **Error Handling**
- ✅ Duplicate migration prevention
- ✅ Missing data validation
- ✅ Registration number conflicts resolution
- ✅ Failed migration logging and retry capability
