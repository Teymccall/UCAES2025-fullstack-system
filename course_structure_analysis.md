# Course Structure Analysis Report

## Comparison Between Existing and User-Provided Structure

### BSc. Sustainable Agriculture

#### DUPLICATES FOUND:
The user-provided structure is **IDENTICAL** to the existing structure in course-data.txt. All courses match exactly.

#### INCONSISTENCIES IDENTIFIED:

##### 1. Year One Semester Two - Course Credit Discrepancies:
**Existing Structure:**
- GNS 152 Basic Statistics: T=2, P=0, C=2

**User Structure:**
- GNS 152 Basic Statistics: T=2, P=0, C=22 (ERROR - should be C=2)

##### 2. Environmental Science Management Course Code Issues:
**User Structure has formatting errors:**
- ESM 161 Principles of Management2: T=2, P=0, C=20 (should be C=2)
- Line formatting issues with course descriptions

##### 3. Energy Course Credit Error:
**User Structure - Renewable Energy Specialization:**
- ESM 485 Electricity Demand and Management: T=3, P=03 (missing credit value)

### BSc. Environmental Science and Management

#### DUPLICATES FOUND:
The Environmental Science program structure is also **IDENTICAL** to existing structure with minor formatting differences.

#### INCONSISTENCIES IDENTIFIED:

##### 1. Course Code Formatting:
**Existing vs User Structure differences:**
- ESM 411 vs ESM 451 (Environmental Management) - inconsistent course codes for same course
- Some elective courses have inconsistent grouping labels

##### 2. Credit Value Errors:
**User Structure errors:**
- Several courses missing proper credit formatting
- Inconsistent T/P/C column alignment

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

### 1. No New Courses Needed
Since the structures are identical, no new course additions are required to the database.

### 2. Fix Data Entry Errors
The following corrections should be made to the user-provided structure:
- GNS 152: Change C=22 to C=2
- ESM 161: Change C=20 to C=2
- ESM 485: Add missing credit value (should be C=3)

### 3. Standardize Course Codes
Ensure consistency in course code usage:
- ESM 411 vs ESM 451 for Environmental Management
- Verify all course codes follow proper format (XXX ###)

### 4. Database Integrity
Current database structure in course-data.txt is accurate and complete. No updates needed.

## DETAILED COURSE COMPARISON:

### Identical Courses (No Action Needed):
All courses in both programs match the existing database structure exactly, with the exception of the formatting errors noted above.

### Course Code Validation:
All course codes follow the proper format:
- AGM (Agriculture and Management): 151-465
- ANS (Animal Science): 152-462  
- ESM (Environmental Science and Management): 151-496
- GNS (General Studies): 151-356
- AEE (Agricultural Economics and Extension): 451-459
- HOR (Horticulture): 451-458
- AQS (Aquatic Science): 451-466
- WEH (Water and Environmental Health): 451-471

### Specialization Structure:
Both programs follow consistent specialization patterns:
- Core courses common across specializations
- Elective groups (A, B, C) properly structured
- Semester distribution balanced

## CONCLUSION:
The user-provided structure is essentially a duplicate of the existing structure with minor transcription errors. The current database is complete and accurate. Only formatting corrections are needed in the user's document.
