# 🎯 STUDENT PORTAL - Course Registration Lock Test Guide

## ✅ **CORRECT LOCATION CONFIRMED**
I've now applied the registration lock fixes to the **CORRECT** student portal course registration page:
- **File**: `new student portal/app/course-registration/page.tsx`
- **URL**: Should be accessible from the student portal dashboard

---

## 🔧 **Applied Fixes to Student Portal**

### ✅ **Enhanced Debugging (with "STUDENT PORTAL" prefix)**
1. **🚀 Eligibility Check Logging**: `STUDENT PORTAL - ELIGIBILITY CHECK USEEFFECT TRIGGERED`
2. **🔴 Tab Click Logging**: `STUDENT PORTAL - REGISTER TAB CLICKED!`
3. **🔄 State Change Tracking**: `STUDENT PORTAL - STATE CHANGE`
4. **📊 System Config Monitoring**: `STUDENT PORTAL - System Config Changed`
5. **🟡 Visual Debug Panel**: Yellow box showing current state
6. **🏷️ Tab State Indicator**: Shows "UNLOCKED/LOCKED" on tab

### ✅ **Lock Mechanism**
- **Default State**: `canRegister = false` (locked until verified)
- **Tab Disabled**: When fees unpaid, tab is disabled with lock icon
- **Red Notice**: Clear message with "Go to Fees Portal" button
- **Force Check**: Manual trigger button for testing
- **Real-time Updates**: Monitors payment/wallet changes

## 🧪 **How to Test the Student Portal**

### **Step 1: Access Student Portal**
1. Go to the **student portal** (not the main course registration)
2. Login as **JUDITH STLYES** (Registration: UCAES20250022)
3. Navigate to **Course Registration** from dashboard
4. **Open browser console (F12)**

### **Step 2: Look for Debug Panel**
You should see a **yellow debug box** with:
```
🔧 STUDENT PORTAL DEBUG INFO
Student ID: iJ5wJl9oW6rbMVHMZJzP
Registration Lock State: 🔒 LOCKED (if fees unpaid)
Lock Reason: Fees must be paid before course registration...
System Config: 2020-2021 - Second Semester
Config Loading: No
```

### **Step 3: Check Console Logs**
Look for these logs **with "STUDENT PORTAL" prefix**:
```
📊 STUDENT PORTAL - System Config Changed: {...}
🔄 STUDENT PORTAL - STATE CHANGE - canRegister: false
🚀 STUDENT PORTAL - ELIGIBILITY CHECK USEEFFECT TRIGGERED
Student ID: iJ5wJl9oW6rbMVHMZJzP
✅ STUDENT PORTAL - Prerequisites met, running eligibility check
🚀🚀🚀 ELIGIBILITY CHECK FUNCTION CALLED! 🚀🚀🚀
🚀 Student: iJ5wJl9oW6rbMVHMZJzP
🚀 Academic Year: 2020-2021
🚀 Semester: 2
✅ Found student in student-registrations: {...}
👨‍🎓 Student iJ5wJl9oW6rbMVHMZJzP: Programme type regular, Level 100
💵 FEE CHECK DETAILED RESULT for student iJ5wJl9oW6rbMVHMZJzP:
💵 Balance Amount: [amount]
🔒 STUDENT PORTAL - Registration locked: [reason]
```

### **Step 4: Test Tab Behavior**
- Try clicking **"Register Courses"** tab
- Should see: `🔴 STUDENT PORTAL - REGISTER TAB CLICKED!`
- Tab should show **"LOCKED"** indicator
- Tab should be **disabled** (grayed out)

---

## 🔍 **Expected Results**

### **If Student Has NOT Paid Fees:**
- ✅ Debug panel shows: `🔒 LOCKED`
- ✅ Tab shows: "Register Courses LOCKED" with lock icon
- ✅ Tab is disabled (grayed out, not clickable)
- ✅ Red notice appears with fee payment message
- ✅ Console shows: `🔒 STUDENT PORTAL - Registration locked`

### **If Student HAS Paid Fees:**
- ✅ Debug panel shows: `🔓 UNLOCKED`
- ✅ Tab shows: "Register Courses UNLOCKED"
- ✅ Tab is clickable
- ✅ Console shows: `✅ STUDENT PORTAL - Registration allowed`

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **No "STUDENT PORTAL" Logs?**
- You might be on the wrong course registration page
- Make sure you're in the **student portal**, not the main system
- Look for the yellow debug box with "STUDENT PORTAL DEBUG INFO"

### **Tab Still Unlocked?**
1. Click **"Force Check"** button in red notice
2. Check console for fee check results
3. Verify academic year (should be updated to 2024-2025)

### **Still No Lock?**
- Check if student actually has payment records
- Fee calculation service might not be working
- Academic year mismatch (2020-2021 vs current)

## 🎯 **Key Differences from Main System**

1. **Logs Prefixed**: All logs have "STUDENT PORTAL" prefix
2. **Debug Panel**: Shows "STUDENT PORTAL DEBUG INFO"
3. **Same Logic**: Uses the same `canStudentRegisterForSemester` function
4. **Same Lock Mechanism**: Identical tab disabling and notice system
