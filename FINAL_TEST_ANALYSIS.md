## 🔍 **Diagnostic Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: No Eligibility Check Logs**
**Symptoms**: No `🚀 ELIGIBILITY CHECK FUNCTION CALLED!` logs
**Cause**: useEffect not running or failing silently
**Look for**: `⏳ Waiting for prerequisites` message
**Action**: Use "Force Check" button

### **Scenario 2: Fee Check Fails**
**Symptoms**: `🚨 CRITICAL: No semester fees returned`
**Causes**: 
- Fee calculation service not working
- Academic year mismatch (2020-2021 vs current)
- Student has no fee structure
**Action**: Update academic year or check fee service

### **Scenario 3: Tab Still Unlocked**
**Symptoms**: Debug panel shows `🔓 UNLOCKED`, tab clickable
**Causes**: 
- Fee check returned balance = 0 (student paid)
- Fee check failed and defaulted to allow
- State not updating properly
**Look for**: `💵 Balance Amount:` in console

### **Scenario 4: Student Has Paid**
**Symptoms**: `✅ FEES PAID: Balance is 0, student can register`
**Result**: Tab should be unlocked (this is correct behavior)
**Action**: Verify payment records in Firebase

## 🚨 **Expected Results Based on Payment Status**

### **If Student Has NOT Paid Fees:**
- ✅ Debug panel: `🔒 LOCKED`
- ✅ Tab shows: "Register Courses LOCKED" with lock icon
- ✅ Console shows: `🔒 FEES UNPAID: Balance is ¢[amount]`
- ✅ Red notice appears below tabs
- ✅ Cannot click into tab or see course list

### **If Student HAS Paid Fees:**

## 📊 **What the Logs Will Tell Us**

## 🔧 **Known Issues to Fix**
