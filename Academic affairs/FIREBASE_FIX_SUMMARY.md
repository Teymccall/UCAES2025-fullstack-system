# Firebase Admin Initialization Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing errors like:
```
TypeError: _firebase_admin__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.adminDb.collection is not a function
```

This was happening because the Firebase Admin SDK was not being properly initialized when imported directly.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `firebase-admin.ts` file where `adminDb` was exported as a legacy export that wasn't properly initialized. The correct approach is to use getter functions that ensure proper initialization.

## Files Fixed

### 1. Core Firebase Admin Configuration (`lib/firebase-admin.ts`)
- **Before**: Legacy exports that weren't properly initialized
- **After**: Proper getter functions with lazy initialization
- **Changes**:
  - Changed from `export { getDb as adminDb }` to `export const adminDb = getDb()`
  - Added proper initialization checks
  - Ensured service account credentials are loaded correctly

### 2. Database Initialization (`lib/initialize-db.ts`)
- **Before**: Direct import of `adminDb`
- **After**: Using `getDb()` function
- **Changes**:
  - Changed import from `adminDb` to `getDb`
  - Added `const adminDb = getDb()` at the start of each function

### 3. API Routes Fixed
The following API routes were updated to use the proper Firebase initialization:

#### Director Dashboard Routes:
- `app/api/director/dashboard/stats/route.ts`
- `app/api/director/dashboard/approvals/route.ts`
- `app/api/director/dashboard/activities/route.ts`

#### Admissions Routes:
- `app/api/admissions/fix-registration-numbers/route.ts`
- `app/api/admissions/fix-course-registrations/route.ts`
- `app/api/admissions/applications/route.ts`
- `app/api/admissions/applications/[applicationId]/route.ts`

#### Student Routes:
- `app/api/students/confirm-photo/route.ts`

#### Finance Routes:
- `app/api/finance/fee-settings/route.ts`

#### Development Routes:
- `app/api/dev/seed/route.ts`
- `app/api/dev/test-firebase-admin/route.ts`
- `app/api/debug-academic-years/route.ts`

## Pattern Applied
For each file that was using Firebase Admin, the following pattern was applied:

```typescript
// Before
import { adminDb } from '@/lib/firebase-admin';

export async function GET() {
  try {
    const collection = adminDb.collection('some-collection');
    // ...
  }
}

// After
import { getDb } from '@/lib/firebase-admin';

export async function GET() {
  try {
    const adminDb = getDb();
    const collection = adminDb.collection('some-collection');
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Proper Initialization**: Firebase Admin SDK is now properly initialized before use
2. **Error Prevention**: Eliminates the "collection is not a function" errors
3. **Consistent Pattern**: All API routes now follow the same initialization pattern
4. **Better Error Handling**: Proper error handling for Firebase initialization failures

## Testing
The application should now start without Firebase initialization errors. All API routes that interact with Firestore should work correctly.

## Remaining Files
Some files may still need similar fixes if they use Firebase Admin directly. The pattern to follow is:
1. Import `getDb` instead of `adminDb`
2. Call `const adminDb = getDb()` at the start of each function that uses Firebase
