/**
 * Firebase Rules Deployment Script
 * 
 * This script helps deploy the updated Firestore and Realtime Database security rules.
 * It requires the Firebase CLI to be installed and authenticated.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 1. Ensure you have Firebase CLI installed: npm install -g firebase-tools
 * 2. Log in to Firebase: firebase login
 * 3. Run the deployment commands below
 */

/**
 * To deploy only the Firestore security rules:
 * 
 * firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
 * 
 * To deploy only the Realtime Database security rules:
 * 
 * firebase deploy --only database
 * 
 * To deploy Firestore indexes:
 * 
 * firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
 * 
 * To deploy everything (rules and indexes):
 * 
 * firebase deploy --only firestore,database
 * 
 * Note: Make sure to test these rules thoroughly in a development environment
 * before deploying to production, as overly restrictive rules can block legitimate
 * access, while overly permissive rules can create security vulnerabilities.

// Manual verification checklist:
// 
// 1. Verify that users can only access data they're authorized to see
// 2. Confirm that roles (director/staff) are properly enforced
// 3. Test that course assignment restrictions work as expected
// 4. Ensure that permission-based access controls function correctly
// 5. Validate that data validation rules are enforced on write operations
